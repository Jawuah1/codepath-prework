## Task 3
What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
A challenge I encountered was time management, and this project helped me balance school work and the project; I recognized that if you care about something, you will find a way to make time for it. This project has shown how important this is to me and that anything worthwhile takes effort and dedication. I have a little experience with HTML, css, and javascript, but this project showed me how creative and powerful these tools could be, and with more practice and time, I will be able to continue to improve to better my skills. The challenges came, but my passion for coding kept me going as I made sure to make time to work on the project, study for tests, and complete my school work as my drive to improve pushed me. I overcame it by setting a schedule and time for me to work on the project so that I had dedicated time to work on the project, which also helped me stay on track to complete it. I also separated tasks for different times to keep me focused at the highest level. I have already learned so much from this pre-work project, and this project is very creative and complex with the use of git, which has helped me know how to put gifs into the GitHub readme, which I found to be very helpful as these things I have learned I will apply in the future.


What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
My question about web development is simply what more can I do. In this short time, I have already learned so much, and with this project, I want to learn more and improve as I had a great time doing this project by adding some extra features to the game. I want to know everything from the front end to the back end. This internship will aid in answering my questions on web development as I can gain more experience to dive deeper and expand my knowledge. I want to continue developing my skills with HTML, CSS, and javascript as this project showed me how powerful these tools could be, and I want to continue to learn to maximize my abilities.


If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
If I had a few more hours, I would like to add a couple of the bonus tasks that I did not get to complete. Specifically, the addition of the ticking clock and the random pattern task would be an additional feature I would add. Some other functions I would like to add would be to give the user an option to choose different background colors before starting the game, as I feel like this feature could let the individual user customize their in-game experience. With the random pattern, I could have a variable with a range of numbers to be randomly picked for the array so that the pattern can have a multitude of options.
